# 3D-controller (name subject to change)

A project where i try game mechanics of 3rd person 3d games.
Currently the movement is implemented with a CharacterController (instead of the rigidbody i use usually) and the enemy AI with a finite state-machine.

every asset in game is self made, the AI is based on the PluggableAI tutorial by unity ( https://youtu.be/cHUXh5biQMg )
